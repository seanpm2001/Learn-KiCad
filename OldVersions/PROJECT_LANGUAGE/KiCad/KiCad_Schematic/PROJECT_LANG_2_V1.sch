description "I decided to make KiCad Schematic the second language file for this project (seanpm2001/Learn-KiCad) as KiCad is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the KiCad programming languages. KiCad has 2 formats: Layout and Schematic. This is the Schematic representation file. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."
