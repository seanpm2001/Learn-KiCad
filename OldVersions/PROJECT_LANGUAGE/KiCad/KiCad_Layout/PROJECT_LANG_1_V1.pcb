("About: ")
("I decided to make KiCad (layout) the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-KiCad) as KiCad is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the KiCad programming languages. Since there are 2 variants, I am starting with KiCad Layout. It only makes sense to have KiCad layout be the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.")
